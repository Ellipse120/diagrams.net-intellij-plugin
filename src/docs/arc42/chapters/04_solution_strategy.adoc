== Solution Strategy

diagrams.net is a web based diagramming tool which runns in different browsers.
Since IntelliJ version 2020.01, JetBrains added the https://jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/reference_guide/jcef.html[JCEF - Java Chromium Embedded Framework] to its platform.
This enables us to use the powerful chromium browser to run diagrams.net on within IntelliJ.

The diagrams.net documentation has good https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-integration[examples on how to embedd diagrams.not in a stand aline, local HTML page].
These where used as a starting point.
